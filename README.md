# Space-Architects
Project Repo for NASA Space Apps Challenge. We're developing a visual tool that will allow users to design their ideal home in space, following NASA requirements

**SPACE ARCHITECTS PROJECT**  
NASA SPACE APPS CHALLENGE 2025  

Team: Nicole, Aitana, Mishlei, Seyam, Houda  
Date: October 4th 2025  

Space Architects is a visual and interactive tool designed for users to create, modify, and evaluate space habitats following NASA’s guidelines on habitability, zoning, and crew wellbeing.
The goal is to educate and simulate the process of designing a habitat on the Moon or Mars, allowing students, engineers, and enthusiasts to learn the real principles behind space mission planning.
The application allows users to configure the destination (Moon, Mars, or in orbit), the number of crew members, and the mission duration. Based on these parameters, the user can design the habitat by dragging and dropping modules (rest area, kitchen, hygiene, exercise, lab, greenhouse, etc.), receiving visual feedback (green, yellow, or red) depending on compliance with NASA’s habitability standards.

**GENERAL ACCOMMODATION DESCRIPTION**

Shape: Square and vertical (modular tower type)  
Height per level: 2.5 m  
Base: 144 m² (12 × 12 m)  
Usable total volume: 300 m³ per level (12 × 10 × 2.5 m) (central corridor not included)  

**Recommended materials**

Structure: Aluminum alloy reinforced with carbon fiber.  
Insulation: Layers of foam polymers, air, and compacted lunar regolith.  
Radiation protection: Water, polymers, and regolith.  
Interior: Modular, fireproof, antibacterial panels.  

**Basic Requirements**

- Minimum 25 m³ per astronaut (for long missions).  
- Separate noisy areas (gym, machinery) from resting zones.  
- Kitchen and bathroom should not be adjacent.  
- Personal spaces must be isolated from noise and have light control.  
- Circadian lighting (simulates “day” and “night”).  
- Social areas are mandatory for psychological wellbeing.  

**MODULES**

**Airlock (Entry/Exit)**

This area contains:  
- Hermetic door to the exterior
   
This entrance allows astronauts and cargo to enter/exit the facilities. It also serves as an extra storage module, where thay can store their spacesuits and other equipment. This room has an area of 10m² (2.5 × 4 m), which gives its users plenty of space to move and change easily, while keeping the air inside of the building.

**Life Support and Waste**

This area contains:  
- ECLSS Core (Environmental Control and Life Support System)  
- Waste collection: for solid and liquid waste  
- Clinical sink

This area is usually placed at the lowest or central part of the construction to facilitate connections. The ECLSS Core regulates air, temperature and pressure, it purifies CO₂, generates oxygen, recycles water and controls humidity.
Suggested minimum space: 	  
4 people → 8m²  
We have decided to offer a single room option of 10m² (2.5 × 4 m), since the ECLSS core can support up to 7 people if more pallets and tanks are added. However, we recommend installing one additional room for every 4 extra people.

**Maintenance/ Mission planning**

This area contains:  
- Tools, spare parts, and repair equipment  
- Mission planning station  
- Control and communication station 
  
We offer a standard 10m² (2.5 × 4 m) maintenance and planning module that provides space for tools, mission documentation, and a workstation. For extended expeditions or groups, a larger 16m² (4 × 4 m) module is available.

**Storage**

This area is an additional room for storage. We offer a 6m² (2 × 3 m) option and a 10m² (2.5 × 4 m) one.

**Medical operations**

This area contains:  
- Basic medical care: first aid, stretcher, dizziness…  
- Option for telemedical meetings, computer station  
- Clinical sink

Suggested minimum space:   
4 people → 6m²  
This area is essential to ensure the crew’s health and well-being. The room is 10m² (2.5 × 4 m) and we reccomend installing it near the entrance for possible emergencies.

**Sleeping quarters**

This area contains:  
- Individual capsule or bed for each astronaut (2 x 1 m)  
- Soundproof walls with adjustable light

This area is usually located on an upper level, away from machinery noises.  
Suggested minimum space:  
4 people → 6m²  
6 people → 12m²  
To ensure sleep quality and privacy, we offer two sleeping quarter options. Both are 6m², but the first one is individual, and the second has a two-person bunk bed. These rooms can easily be installed one next to another, making it easy to accommodate larger groups of people.

**Kitchen and Dining Area**

This area contains:  
- Small area with compact ovens,  air filters, countertop…
- Table to eat together  
- Storage for freeze-dried food and water
 
Suggested minimum space:  
4 people → 6m²  
6 people → 10m²  
We offer a 10m² (2.5 × 4 m) kitchen which should be enough for up to 6 people. However, we do have a bigger option at 16m² (4 × 4 m) for larger expedition groups, which includes a larger dining table, more cooking spaces and more storage.

**Hygiene and sanitation**

This area contains:  
- Toilet cabin
- Shower / Body wash area (air shower for minimal water use)  
- A sink for handwashing, oral hygiene ..  
- Full-sized mirror

Suggested minimum space:  
4 people → 5m²  
6 people → 8m²  
We offer an option of  6m² (2 × 3 m) but we do recommend installing one unit every two people. For larger groups, we have a 10m² (2.5 × 4 m) option which offers more sinks, showers and toilet cabins.

**Gym**

This area contains:  
- Equipment: stationery bike, treadmill, resistance bands…
 
This area is essential for astronauts to keep in shape while in space. We offer a smaller gym area of 10m² (2.5 × 4 m) and a bigger one at 16m² (4 × 4 m).

**Laboratory**

This area contains:  
- Space for experiments and scientific observation  
- Power connection  
- Computer station  
- Clinical sink

Suggested minimum space: 	
4 people → 8m²  
6 people →12m²  
The lab layout, usage and importance depend on the type of expedition carried out. We offer two lab options:  one of 10m² (2.5 × 4 m) which is suitable for small expeditions, and a larger 16m² (4 × 4 m) version for longer missions or teams conducting more complex research. Both can be equipped with adjustable work spaces, storage and reinforced surfaces.

**Greenhouse**

This area contains:  
- Plant growth modules with LED lighting and drip irrigation systems  
It has ventilation systems and power sources. It is a space for growing fresh food and improving the crew’s well-being.
We offer two greenhouse options: a compact 10m² (2.5 × 4 m) module for small-scale food production and oxygen generation, and a larger 16m² (4 × 4 m) option with extended growing capacity, suitable for longer missions or larger crews.
